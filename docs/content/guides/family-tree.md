# Viewing Your Family Tree

Once you have added people and relationships, Vamsa brings your family to life through a variety of interactive charts. Each chart type presents the same data in a different way, suited to different questions you might want to answer.

To view charts, click **Visualize** in the main navigation.

## Choosing a Chart Type

Use the **Chart Type** dropdown at the top of the Visualize page to switch between views. Most charts also let you select a **focus person** -- the individual at the center of the chart.

### Tree Chart

The classic top-down family tree. This is the default view and the best place to start.

- **Best for**: Seeing the big picture of how your family is connected
- **Layout**: Parents appear above their children, with spouses side by side
- **Focus person**: The tree is rooted at the person you select

!!! tip
    The Tree Chart is the best starting point if you are new to Vamsa. It gives you the most familiar view of your family structure.

### Fan Chart

A circular chart that radiates outward from a center person, showing ancestors in concentric rings.

- **Best for**: Visualizing all of a person's ancestors in a compact, elegant layout
- **Layout**: The focus person sits at the center. Parents occupy the first ring, grandparents the second, and so on
- **Focus person**: The individual at the center of the fan

!!! tip
    Fan charts are especially beautiful when printed or exported as images. They make great gifts for family gatherings.

### Hourglass Chart

Shows both ancestors (above) and descendants (below) of a single person, forming an hourglass shape.

- **Best for**: Seeing a person's place in the family -- who came before them and who came after
- **Layout**: Ancestors expand upward, descendants expand downward, with the focus person in the middle
- **Focus person**: The individual at the center of the hourglass

---

### Ancestor Chart

Traces all ancestors of a person going back through the generations.

- **Best for**: Researching a person's lineage -- "Where did I come from?"
- **Layout**: The focus person appears on the left, with parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents branching to the right
- **Focus person**: The individual whose ancestry you want to explore

---

### Descendant Chart

Shows all descendants of a person going forward through the generations.

- **Best for**: Seeing how a family grew from a single ancestor -- "Who are all the descendants of my great-grandfather?"
- **Layout**: The focus person appears at the top, with children, grandchildren, and further descendants below
- **Focus person**: The ancestor whose descendants you want to see

---

### Bowtie Chart

Combines both parents' family lines, meeting at the focus person in the center. It looks like a bowtie or butterfly shape.

- **Best for**: Seeing both maternal and paternal lineages side by side
- **Layout**: The father's ancestors extend to one side, the mother's ancestors extend to the other, with the focus person in the middle
- **Focus person**: The individual where both family lines converge

---

### Compact Tree

A space-efficient version of the Tree Chart that fits more people on screen.

- **Best for**: Large families where the standard Tree Chart becomes too spread out
- **Layout**: Similar to the Tree Chart but with tighter spacing and a more condensed layout
- **Focus person**: The root of the tree

---

### Timeline Chart

Arranges people along a horizontal timeline based on their birth and death dates.

- **Best for**: Understanding when people lived relative to each other -- "Which ancestors were alive at the same time?"
- **Layout**: Each person is shown as a bar spanning from their birth date to their death date (or present day if living)
- **Sorting**: You can sort by birth date, death date, or name using the sort dropdown

!!! info "People without dates"
    People who do not have birth or death dates recorded will not appear on the Timeline Chart. Add dates to include them.

---

### Relationship Matrix

A grid showing how every person in the tree is related to every other person.

- **Best for**: Quickly finding the relationship between any two people
- **Layout**: A table with people listed along both axes, with the relationship type shown in each cell

---

### Statistics

A dashboard of charts and numbers summarizing your family data.

- **Best for**: Getting an overview of your family tree at a glance
- **Shows**: Age distributions, gender breakdown, geographic locations, number of generations, and other aggregate statistics

---

### List View

A simple text-based list of all people in your tree.

- **Best for**: Quickly scanning or searching through all family members without a visual chart
- **Layout**: A sortable, searchable table of people

---

## Chart Controls

All charts share a common set of controls:

### Selecting a Focus Person

Most charts center on a specific person. To change the focus person:

1. Use the **person selector** dropdown at the top of the chart.
2. Search by name to find the person you want.
3. The chart will re-render around that person.

You can also click on any person in the chart to make them the new focus.

### Generation Depth

Use the **generation slider** to control how many generations the chart shows:

- **Fewer generations**: A simpler, less crowded view
- **More generations**: A more complete picture, but may require more scrolling or zooming

For the Hourglass chart, you can control ancestor generations and descendant generations independently.

### Zoom and Pan

- **Zoom in/out**: Use the zoom controls (+/-) or your mouse scroll wheel
- **Pan**: Click and drag on the background to move around the chart
- **Reset view**: Click the reset button to return to the default zoom level and position

### Exporting Charts as Images

You can save any chart as an image to share or print:

1. Click the **Export** button in the chart controls.
2. Choose your format:
    - **PNG** -- Best for sharing digitally (email, social media)
    - **SVG** -- Best for printing at any size (vector format)
    - **PDF** -- Best for printing a document
3. The file will download to your computer.

!!! tip "Printing large charts"
    For large family trees, export as SVG or PDF. These vector formats can be printed at any size without losing quality, so you can make a poster-sized family tree for a reunion.

## Tips for Getting the Most from Charts

- **Start with the Tree Chart** to get oriented, then switch to specialized charts for specific questions.
- **Use the Hourglass Chart** when you want to show a specific person's complete context -- their ancestors and descendants together.
- **Try the Fan Chart** for a visually striking printout of someone's ancestry.
- **Check the Statistics page** periodically to see how your tree is growing and identify gaps (such as missing dates or locations).
- **Use the Timeline** to discover which relatives lived during the same era -- this can spark interesting family stories.
