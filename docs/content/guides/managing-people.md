# Managing People

Every family tree starts with people. This guide walks you through adding, editing, and organizing the individuals in your family tree.

## Adding a New Person

1. Click the **Add Person** button (the "+" icon) from the main navigation or the People page.
2. Fill in the person's details in the form that appears.
3. Click **Save** to add them to your tree.

### Form Fields

Here is what each field means:

| Field | Required? | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| **First Name** | Yes | The person's given name |
| **Last Name** | Yes | The person's family/surname |
| **Maiden Name** | No | The surname before marriage (if applicable) |
| **Gender** | No | Male, Female, Other, or Prefer Not to Say |
| **Date of Birth** | No | When the person was born |
| **Birth Place** | No | Where the person was born |
| **Native Place** | No | The family's place of origin or ancestral home |
| **Date of Passing** | No | When the person passed away (leave blank for living people) |
| **Living** | No | Whether the person is still alive (checked by default) |
| **Bio** | No | Free-text notes, stories, or biographical information |
| **Profession** | No | The person's occupation |
| **Employer** | No | Where the person works or worked |
| **Email** | No | Contact email address |
| **Phone** | No | Contact phone number |
| **Current Address** | No | Street, city, state, postal code, and country |
| **Work Address** | No | Same format as current address |
| **Social Links** | No | Facebook, Twitter/X, LinkedIn, Instagram, or other URLs |

!!! tip "Start with what you know"
    You only need a first and last name to create a person. You can always come back and fill in more details later as you gather information from family members.

## Understanding Date Formats

Vamsa accepts dates in standard ISO format:

- **Full date**: `1952-03-15` (March 15, 1952)
- **Year and month**: `1952-03` (March 1952, when you do not know the exact day)
- **Year only**: `1952` (when you only know the year)

!!! info "What if I only know an approximate date?"
    Use the closest date you have and add a note in the Bio field explaining the uncertainty. For example: "Birth year is approximate, based on family oral history."

## Editing a Person's Details

1. Navigate to the person's profile page by clicking their name anywhere in the app.
2. Click the **Edit** button.
3. Update any fields you need to change.
4. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

All changes are saved immediately and will be reflected across every chart and view in the app.

## Uploading Photos and Media

You can attach photos and documents to any person in your tree.

1. Open the person's profile page.
2. Go to the **Media** section.
3. Click **Upload** or drag and drop files into the upload area.

!!! info "Supported formats and limits"
    - **Images**: JPEG, PNG, WebP, GIF
    - **Documents**: PDF
    - **File size**: Each file can be up to the limit set by your server administrator (typically 10 MB)

!!! tip "Use meaningful photos"
    A clear portrait works best as the person's primary photo. It will appear as their avatar throughout the app, including on charts and search results.

## Deleting a Person

Deleting a person removes them and all their associated data from the tree.

1. Open the person's profile page.
2. Click **Edit**, then scroll to the bottom.
3. Click **Delete Person**.
4. Confirm the deletion in the dialog that appears.

!!! warning "Deletion is permanent"
    When you delete a person, their relationships are also removed. For example, if you delete a parent, the parent-child links to their children will be gone. The children themselves will remain in the tree, but they will no longer show that parent connection. Consider exporting a backup before deleting anyone.

## Tips for Better Data

- **Be consistent with names.** Decide on a naming convention and stick with it. For example, always use full legal names rather than nicknames.
- **Add maiden names.** This helps distinguish people who share married surnames and preserves family name history.
- **Use the Bio field generously.** Record stories, anecdotes, and context that do not fit into structured fields. This is often the most valuable information for future generations.
- **Record native places.** If your family has roots in a specific village or region, the Native Place field is a great way to track ancestral geography.
- **Mark living status accurately.** This affects how the person appears in some charts and in calendar feeds.
